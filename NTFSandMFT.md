# Beginner NTFS and MFT Analysis

Analysis of new technology file system (NTFS) and master file tables (MFT) files using a Windows disk image.

It is recommended to carry out this process on a virtual machine.

During your analysis, you should be mindful of [anti-forensic techniques](https://github.com/dbak5/BeginnerCybersecurityGuides/blob/main/AntiForensicTechniques.md) that may be used by a threat actor to cover up their tracks.

## Timeline and evidence

Create a timeline of the events you have uncovered and record all evidence found, including screenshots.

Crowdstrike have an Incident Response Tracker Template which you can download [here](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/crowdstrike-releases-digital-forensics-and-incident-response-tracker/).

It is also good to align events with the MITRE ATT&CK framework. [Here](https://www.socinvestigation.com/mapping-mitre-attck-with-window-event-log-ids/) is an example.
